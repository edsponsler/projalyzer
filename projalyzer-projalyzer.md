# Projalyzer Analysis Report

## 1. Project Summary:

Projalyzer is a Python-based project that uses the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) to analyze other Python projects. It employs a multi-agent system to generate a comprehensive report that includes:

*   A high-level summary of the target project.
*   Suggestions for code improvements and optimizations.
*   A development plan outlining the next steps for the project.
*   Ideas for new features that could be added.
*   Ready-to-use prompts for the Gemini CLI to implement the suggestions.

The project's architecture consists of several specialized agents, including:

*   Project Summarizer
*   Improvement Suggester
*   Development Planner
*   New Feature Ideator
*   Activity Selector
*   Prompt Generator
*   Report Writer

The `main.py` script orchestrates the agents using the ADK and takes the path to the project to be analyzed as a command-line argument. The `ReportGenerator` agent is the main entry point for the analysis. The project uses `google-adk` as its primary dependency. The project also includes logging to a file for debugging purposes. The project appears to be functional, with a clear entry point and defined workflow. The `README.md` provides detailed instructions on how to set up and run the project.

## 2. Chosen Activities:

### Improvement:

Moving constants like `LOG_FILE`, `APP_NAME`, `USER_ID`, and `SESSION_ID` to a dedicated configuration file or environment variables will make the application more configurable and easier to deploy. This is a relatively simple change that can have a significant impact on the project's maintainability and scalability.

### Development:

Defining clear data structures for the outputs of the `ImprovementSuggester`, `DevelopmentPlanner`, and `NewFeatureIdeator` agents is crucial for the proper functioning of the entire system. This will ensure that the `ActivitySelector` can reliably process the suggestions and that the `PromptGenerator` can create targeted prompts. This is a foundational change that will enable more sophisticated functionality in the future.

### New Feature:

Integrating Projalyzer into CI/CD pipelines would provide developers with immediate feedback on potential improvements and new feature ideas. This would significantly improve the efficiency of the development process and ensure that code quality is maintained.

## 3. Gemini CLI Prompts:

### Improvement Prompt:

```
Create a project outline with clear steps to implement centralized configuration for the Projalyzer project. 
The goal is to move constants like LOG_FILE, APP_NAME, USER_ID, and SESSION_ID from main.py to a dedicated configuration file (e.g., config.py or a .env file) or using environment variables.
The outline should include:
1.  Choosing an appropriate configuration method (e.g., config.py, .env file, or environment variables).
2.  Creating the configuration file or setting up environment variables.
3.  Modifying main.py to read the constants from the configuration file or environment variables.
4.  Updating any other parts of the code that use these constants.
5.  Testing the changes to ensure that the application still functions correctly.
```

### Development Prompt:

```
Create a project outline with clear steps to define data structures for the outputs of the ImprovementSuggester, DevelopmentPlanner, and NewFeatureIdeator agents in the Projalyzer project.
This will ensure that the ActivitySelector can reliably process the suggestions and that the PromptGenerator can create targeted prompts.
The outline should include:
1. Defining a common data structure (e.g., a dictionary with fields like 'title', 'description', 'category', and 'priority') for the outputs of the three agents.
2. Modifying the ImprovementSuggester, DevelopmentPlanner, and NewFeatureIdeator agents to structure their outputs according to the defined data structure.
3. Updating the ActivitySelector and PromptGenerator agents to process the structured outputs.
4. Writing unit tests to verify that the agents are generating and processing the structured outputs correctly.
```

### New Feature Prompt:

```
Create a project outline with clear steps to integrate Projalyzer into CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI). This integration should automatically analyze projects upon code commits or pull requests.
The outline should include:
1.  Selecting a CI/CD platform (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).
2.  Creating a CI/CD pipeline configuration file.
3.  Configuring the pipeline to run Projalyzer on code commits or pull requests.
4.  Integrating the analysis results into the CI/CD pipeline report.
5.  Testing the integration to ensure that it works correctly.
```
